Example case with time varying (surface and large scale) forcings
- Large scale advection of moisture ([force] swls & swtimedep_ls)
- Nudging of a scalar "s" ([force] swnudge & swtimedep_nudge)
- Subsidence ([force] swwls & swtimedep_wls
- Surface pressure ([thermo] swtimedep_pbot)
- Time varying surface fluxes of thl ([boundary] swtimedep)
